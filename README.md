# 📍 Shortest Path Analysis Using Sri Lankan Cities  

This repository contains the **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (ADSA)** in-class project (2025).  
The project focuses on implementing and comparing shortest path algorithms using Sri Lankan cities as test cases.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
The main goals of this project are:  
1. Select two cities from a predefined list of Sri Lankan cities.  
2. Compute the **shortest distance** between them.  
3. Implement **at least three different shortest path algorithms**  
4. Display the **entire distance matrix** and/or **visualize the results** for better understanding.

## 🗂 Features  
- Distance matrix representation of Sri Lankan cities  
- Multiple shortest path algorithm implementations  
- Comparative analysis of algorithms  
- Visualisation of results for enhanced clarity
